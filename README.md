# esp32thermometer
A temperature sensor with display and logging capabilities to allow some
easy experiments.

Work in progress. May be modes but should be something that you can easily
use to build and experiment

## Submodules
As the repo uses Submodules make sure you run these commands after cloning the repo
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Check the directory micropythonexamples after this to make sure it is now containing
files.

## Build and run
Use RUN.sh in top directory to build and run. See micropython/README.md for more
details on how to build and run code on esp32.


## Hardware
See hardware directory for connection diagrams etc.
